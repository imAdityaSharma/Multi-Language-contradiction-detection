## The Challenge:

If you have two sentences, there are three ways they could be related: 
1. one could entail the other, 
2. one could contradict the other, 
3. they could be unrelated.

Natural Language Inferencing (NLI) is a popular NLP problem that involves determining how pairs of sentences (consisting of a premise and a hypothesis) are related.
